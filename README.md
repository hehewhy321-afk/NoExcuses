## 🚀 Roadmap & Pending Tasks
We're always looking to make the roasts more savage and the app more reliable. Here's what's currently on the radar:

### 🛠 Critical Fixes
- **Notification Reliability**: Occasionally, scheduled notifications might not trigger if the device is under heavy battery optimization (OEM-specific issues like MIUI/OxygenOS).
- **Background Refresh**: Implement a more robust background worker (WorkManager) to refresh pre-generated roasts if the app hasn't been opened for days.

### ✨ Future Features
- **Voice Roasts**: Use Text-to-Speech (TTS) to play the roast out loud as soon as you tap the notification.
- **Location-Based Roasts**: Get Roasted if the AI detects you're at a gym but your heart rate is 60, or if you're at a fast-food joint.
- **Social Sharing**: Share the most brutal burns directly to Instagram/Twitter to shame yourself publicly.
- **Custom AI Personas**: Choose between "Evil Twin", "Disappointed Mom", or "Drill Sergeant" personalities.
